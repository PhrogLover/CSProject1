                        <p> The application of computers to clinical and administrative medicine. Software expert systems have been written that enable a computer to take a more detailed and accurate medical history than is possible with the time available to the average doctor. It has been found that patients will often communicate more freely with a computer than with a doctor. Computer programs now make a better job of interpreting electrocardiograms than most doctors. Expert diagnostic systems that learn by experience are beginning to rival the best doctors in accuracy. They also provide considerable help in selecting appropriate drugs and dosage. Computers have a major role to play in a wide range of medical administrative tasks.</p>
                        <p>Critically ill patients require large number of therapeutic interventions to optimize their chances of survival. For this, the variables must be collected frequently and the data derived therefrom made available to the clinicians and nursing staff. This results in a large quantity of information, which may loose its significance unless the data recorded is presented in a clear manner. In the intensive care unit it is now possible to computerise the total management of data recorded on the patients. Data management includes the entry, integration and reporting of all vital signs, medications, intake and output volumes and laboratory values.</p>
                        <p>Medical informatics is a rapidly growing discipline. It seeks to organize and manage information in support of patient care, biomedical research and education through the aid of computer and information networks. A computerized hospital information system can establish consistent standards in the transmission and storage of data and continuously monitor all transactions. It provides easy access to valuable patient care information. The physicians can have direct access to all the information of his/her patient through the use of computer. A hospital information system generally covers areas like registration, admission/transfer/discharge, billing, medical record, index, wards, operation theater scheduling, stores/inventory, pharmacy, diet, CSSD, bio-medical maintenance, payroll, accounts, etc.

                            To date, several software vendors have developed hospital systems relating to managing hospitals. Generally hospital administrators prefer to buy ready made package and customize the same to suit their needs.</p>
