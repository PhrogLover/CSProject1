                        <p>Nearly every car on the roads today contains computers. Not just on the dashboard, but deep within the car, constantly working to increase the safety and efficiency of the vehicle. ABS, for example, now taken for granted, modulates brake usage under heavy braking to stop the brakes locking up which could cause an accident. Stability control has been fitted on all new cars as standard since 2014, and detects when a car loses grip on a road surface, applying braking force to individual wheels to maintain control.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Higher end cars make even more use of such systems, with traction control cutting power to prevent wheelspin, and a whole host of features such as parking assistance or automatic emergency braking, which can help to protect pedestrians as well as the driver. Such technology in cars is not necessarily entirely based around safety, as systems can improve the experience of the driver or passengers of the car. Some luxury vehicles can now use cameras to scan the road ahead, then lift the wheels of the car before any sharp bumps to increase comfort. <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScpgI1w5F6A>Watch Here</a></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Presently, some cars are even able to drive semi-autonomously, albeit with driver assistance. They make use of machine learning and image recognition to build an accurate representation of their environment, and take appropriate action. The camera feeds images into the system, which are processed in real time to allow the car to recognise pedestrians, other cars, and even road signs. <a href  = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKXztwtXaGo>This Video</a> shows just how complex the system is.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Fully-self driving cars are also under development from a host of major companies such as Tesla, Google, and a whole host of other manufacturers. Many are currently undergoing testing, but it remains to be seen whether they will be cleared to drive on public roads. Each of these systems, from simple ABS to self-driving cars, relies on inputs from a variety of sensors around the vehicle, processed by an algorithm that must be entirely robust, thus demonstrating the true importance of CS in motoring.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In fact, modern vehicles would not even be able to function at all without CS, as all cars manufactured use an ECU to regulate the vehicle engine, improving both performance and efficiency. With the rapid increase in electric cars on our roads, it seems certain that the impact of CS on motoring can only become more extreme.</p>
